## 10. Risks and mitigations (table or list)

- R-001: `Ambiguous requirements interpretation` | probability: medium | impact: medium | mitigation: `Request clarification from user for any ambiguous TODO items before implementation` | owner: `Stuart Williams`

## 11. Assumptions (list)

- User will provide clarification for any ambiguous requirements discovered during analysis
- Existing repository structure and file paths are stable and should not be modified
- The primary audience for these instructions is AI assistants (specifically GitHub Copilot)
- Instructions should follow the repository's existing tone and style established in README.md and AGENTS.md
- All referenced files and paths in the current repository are correct and accessible

## 12. Implementation approach / Technical narrative (detailed, up to 1000-2000 words)

### Overview

The implementation will systematically replace each TODO item with comprehensive, unambiguous instructions designed specifically for AI assistant comprehension. The approach emphasizes clarity, enforceability, and consistency with existing repository guidance.

### TODO Analysis and Categorization

Based on the current `copilot-instructions.md` file, there are 8 distinct TODO items that fall into two main categories:

#### **Category 1: Project Methodologies (7 items)**

1. Branching strategy and development workflow
2. Short-lived branch requirements and PR process
3. Branch and PR naming conventions
4. Commit message conventions
5. Branch and commit process (rebase/squash)
6. XML reinforcement for branch/commit process
7. Mermaid diagram for branch/commit process

#### **Category 2: Coding Standards (1 item)**

1. General coding standards and references to project-specific guidelines

### Implementation Strategy

#### 1. Branching Strategy and Development Workflow

Will implement a comprehensive section defining:

- Trunk-based development principles with specific requirements
- Branch lifecycle management (creation, work, merge, cleanup)
- Integration with existing CI/CD practices
- Enforcement through XML blocks with `<REQUIREMENT>` tags

#### 2. Commit and PR Conventions

Will create detailed specifications for:

- Conventional commit format with specific patterns
- PR naming conventions aligned with branch naming
- Required PR content and review processes
- Automated enforcement guidelines

#### 3. Reinforcement Techniques Implementation

The plan employs three primary reinforcement techniques:

**XML Reinforcement Blocks**: Critical instructions will be wrapped in semantic XML tags:

```xml
<REQUIREMENT type="MANDATORY">
AI assistants MUST create branches using the pattern: feature/brief-description
</REQUIREMENT>
```

**Mermaid Process Diagrams**: Complex workflows will be visualized:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Create Feature Branch] --> B[Make Small Commits]
    B --> C[Create PR]
    C --> D[Code Review]
    D --> E[Squash and Merge]
```

**Markdown Emphasis**: Strategic use of **bold**, _italic_, and `code` formatting to highlight critical instructions.

### Integration with Existing Documentation

The implementation will maintain consistency with:

- `AGENTS.md`: Respecting the hierarchy of instructions and cross-referencing approach
- `README.md`: Following the established best practices and tone
- Existing instruction files: Ensuring no conflicts with backend, frontend, or documentation guidelines
- `settings.json`: Respecting the established VS Code configuration patterns

### Coding Standards Approach

Rather than duplicating standards, the implementation will:

- Reference existing documentation files where they exist
- Create placeholder structure for standards that should be developed later
- Establish clear patterns for AI assistants to follow when standards files are expanded
- Maintain consistency with the repository's educational and template nature

### Validation and Quality Assurance

Each implemented section will include:

- Specific, measurable requirements that can be programmatically verified
- Examples and counter-examples for clarity
- Clear escalation paths for edge cases or conflicts
- Integration points with existing repository tools and processes

### Technical Implementation Details

The implementation will preserve the existing file structure and formatting while:

- Replacing TODO markers with substantive content
- Maintaining proper Markdown hierarchy and formatting
- Ensuring all file references are valid and accessible
- Following the established repository conventions for documentation

## 13. Testing & validation plan

- **Content Validation**: Each TODO replacement will be manually reviewed for completeness and clarity
- **Syntax Validation**: All XML blocks and Mermaid diagrams will be tested for proper syntax
- **Link Validation**: All file references and paths will be verified to exist in the repository
- **Consistency Testing**: Cross-reference check against AGENTS.md, README.md, and instruction files
- **TODO Completion**: Automated grep search to confirm zero remaining TODO items

## 14. Deployment plan & roll-back strategy

- **Environments**: Single file modification in development branch
- **Deployment Steps**:
  1. Create feature branch from main
  2. Implement all TODO replacements
  3. Validate against acceptance criteria
  4. Commit changes with appropriate commit message
  5. Push branch and create PR for review
- **Roll-back Strategy**: Simple git revert of changes if issues are discovered post-merge

## 15. Monitoring & observability

- **Success Metrics**: Completion tracked by TODO count and user acceptance
- **Quality Metrics**: Manual review scores for clarity and completeness
- **Compliance Metrics**: Adherence to existing repository patterns and styles

## 16. Compliance, security & privacy considerations

- **Data Classification**: Documentation content only, no sensitive data involved
- **Repository Standards**: Must maintain consistency with existing Capgemini template repository standards
- **AI Safety**: Instructions must not create opportunities for AI assistants to make unauthorized changes

## 17. Communication plan

- **Milestone Notifications**: Status updates to user/requester at each milestone completion
- **Issue Escalation**: Immediate notification if conflicts or ambiguities are discovered
- **Completion Notification**: Final notification with summary of changes and validation results

- Current file: `/Users/stuartwilliams/src/github.com/capgemini/template-github-copilot/.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Referenced files: `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `settings.json`

## 19. Appendix (examples, data samples, migration mappings)

### Current TODO Items Inventory

1. `TODO branching strategy (prefer lightweight, trunk-based-development, small but numerous commits), commit message conventions, PR review process, CI/CD practices, etc.`
2. `TODO only work in short-lived branches, create PRs for all changes, get at least one approval before merging, etc.`
3. `TODO reinforcement of branch and PR naming conventions, e.g., feature/brief-description, fix/brief-description, docs/brief-description, etc.`
4. `TODO reinforcement of commit message conventions, e.g., use imperative mood, reference issues, etc.`
5. `TODO reinforcement of branch and commit process, e.g., rebase before merging, squash commits, etc.`
6. `TODO reinforcement of branch and commit process, using embedded XML text structures to reinforce instructions to the AI assistant.`
7. `TODO reinforcement of branch and commit process, using Mermaid process diagram to reinforce instructions to the AI assistant.`
8. `TODO general coding standards, linting rules, formatting guidelines, etc.` / `TODO make a reference to project-specific coding standards, linting rules, formatting guidelines, etc. They will be found in docs/engineering/standards.md or similar.`

### Implementation Priority Matrix
